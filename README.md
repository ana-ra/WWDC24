# CapoEduca App

## About the Project

Capoeira Master is an innovative app designed to immerse users in the art and culture of Capoeira, leveraging the power of SwiftUI to create a fluid and engaging user experience. Inspired by the rich history of Capoeira as a symbol of freedom and resistance for the Afro-Brazilian people, this app aims not only to teach the physical movements but also to share the knowledge and philosophy behind this profound cultural practice. Conceived as a project for WWDC2024, Capoeira Master represents a fusion of technology and tradition, highlighting the versatility and depth of SwiftUI and AVFoundation in bringing cultural heritage to life.

## Technologies Used

### SwiftUI
We utilized SwiftUI, Apple's user interface framework, to build an app with a modern and responsive design. SwiftUI enabled us to create a visually rich and interactive experience with smooth animations and intuitive navigation, making the learning of Capoeira accessible to all, regardless of skill level.

### AVFoundation
To enrich the app with authentic Capoeira sounds, we turned to AVFoundation. We captured and integrated music and rhythms created with traditional Capoeira instruments, such as the berimbau and atabaque, using Apple's GarageBand to refine these recordings. This approach ensures that users have an immersive experience, practicing Capoeira with realistic musical accompaniment.

## Design and Art

Every visual element in Capoeira Master was meticulously hand-drawn, from icons to movement illustrations, reflecting the authenticity and beauty of Capoeira. These hand-made drawings were then digitized and integrated into the app, preserving the handcrafted charm and personal connection to the art of Capoeira.

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for creating Capoeira Master comes from the impactful history of Capoeira and its significance to the Afro-Brazilian people. The practice of Capoeira, with its roots in defense techniques disguised as dance, is a powerful symbol of freedom and resistance. This app is our tribute to this tradition, aiming to share its rich cultural legacy and promote awareness of its historical and cultural importance.
